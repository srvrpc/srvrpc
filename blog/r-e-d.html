        <article>
          <p>Recently I made an attempt at rhyming words, to which I added more words to make it seem like there's some meaning to it. So here it goes...</p>

<p><em>Roses are red<br>
I have no bread<br>
Why all this dread?<br>
I'd rather be dead<br>
But then God said<br>
oh, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_is_dead" target="_blank">God is dead</a><br>
uh, the dead God said<br>
child, check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led_Zeppelin" target="_blank">led</a><br>
I check out the led<br>
It lit up my head<br>
Got 'em blues shed<br>
Look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Page" target="_blank">Jimmy</a> shred<br>
Like there's no days ahead<br>
I see the same in my head<br>
Of the days ahead<br>
When we all go dead<br>
Because for reasons so red<br>
Much hatred we've spread<br>
Power and greed have wed<br>
Now ready is the warhead<br>
So much I've bled<br>
And many did I behead<br>
Spitting on all who pled<br>
The world is now red<br>
I'd rather be dead<br>
Why all this dread?<br>
I have no bread<br>
and, roses are red</em></p>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> Even though I didn't mean anything by this and it was just a random attempt, I'd like to use this opportunity to promote the concept of <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328713001328" target="_blank">RED (Radical Ecological Democracy)</a>, an alternative framework of development for India authored by <a href="https://ashishkothari.in/" target="_blank">Ashish Kothari</a>, an Indian environmentalist and one of the founders of the NGO <a href="http://www.kalpavriksh.org/" target="_blank">Kalpavriksh</a>.</p>
